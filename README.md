# Advanced-Home-Security-with-Face-recognition-integrated-with-ESP32
The project aims to reduce manual work of opening door locks and allow hands-free access to doors from anywhere. The ESP-32 microcontroller captures the image based on the commands given by the admin, once captured the images are sent to telegram app where the admin confirms the identification of person on door. Admin will give confirmation to open the door lock through GUI of Telegram . Finally, when the person enters inside the admin can lock the door else the algorithm locks the door automatically in 10sec.
These are used for security purpose in real-world where securing important resources becomes a key aspect in various environments.


## Overview  
This repository features an **Advanced Home Security System** that leverages **Face Recognition** technology integrated with the **ESP32 microcontroller**. The system is designed to enhance home security by identifying individuals at the entrance and granting or denying access based on predefined criteria.  

## Features  
- **Face Recognition:**  
  - Detect and identify faces using a trained dataset.  
  - Grant or deny access based on stored face profiles.  
- **ESP32 Integration:**  
  - Real-time communication between the face recognition module and the ESP32.  
  - Control security mechanisms like door locks or alarms.  
- **Cloud Connectivity (Optional):**  
  - Log access attempts and send alerts to a mobile device.  
- **Security Features:**  
  - Unauthorized access alerts.  
  - Logs of all access attempts with timestamps.  

## Workflow  
1. **Face Data Collection:** Capture face data and create a database of authorized individuals.  
2. **Face Recognition Module:**  
   - Detect faces using a camera module.  
   - Match detected faces with the stored database.  
3. **ESP32 Communication:**  
   - Send match results to the ESP32 via serial or wireless communication.  
   - Control connected devices like door locks or alarms based on results.  
4. **Logging and Alerts:** Optionally send access logs to the cloud or mobile device.  

## Applications  
- **Home Security:** Monitor and control access to your home.  
- **Office Security:** Implement a secure access system for workplaces.  
- **Smart Locks:** Integrate with IoT-enabled smart lock systems.  

## Requirements  
- **Hardware:**  
  - ESP32 microcontroller  
  - Camera module (e.g., ESP32-CAM or external camera)  
  - Relay module for door lock control  
  - Power supply for ESP32  
- **Software:**  
  - Python (for face recognition model training and testing)  
  - Arduino IDE (for ESP32 programming)  
  - Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow (or similar for face recognition)
