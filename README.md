# Advanced-Home-Security-with-Face-recognition-integrated-with-ESP32
The project aims to reduce manual work of opening door locks and allow hands-free access to doors from anywhere. The ESP-32 microcontroller captures the image based on the commands given by the admin, once captured the images are sent to telegram app where the admin confirms the identification of person on door. Admin will give confirmation to open the door lock through GUI of Telegram . Finally, when the person enters inside the admin can lock the door else the algorithm locks the door automatically in 10sec.
These are used for security purpose in real-world where securing important resources becomes a key aspect in various environments.
